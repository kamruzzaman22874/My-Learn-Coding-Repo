									Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use

									How does the private route work?
								</summary>
								<p className='px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400'>
									The private route component is similar to the public route,
									the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate
									condition. If the user is not authenticated he will be
									redirected to the login page and the user can only access the
									authenticated routes If he is authenticated (Logged in).
