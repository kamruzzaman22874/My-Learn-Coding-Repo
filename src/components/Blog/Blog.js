									The private route component is similar to the public route,
									the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate
									condition. If the user is not authenticated he will be
									redirected to the login page and the user can only access the
									authenticated routes If he is authenticated (Logged in).

									Node js is really poular because it lets you go out of the

									accesing files in the computer,etc.Node js is also popular
									because it uses javascript
